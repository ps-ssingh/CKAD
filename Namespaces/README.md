# Imperative Commands Guide

This guide focuses on the use of imperative commands in Kubernetes, which are useful for executing one-time tasks and generating template definitions quickly. Such commands are particularly helpful during exams to save time.

## Preliminaries

Before using the commands, familiarize yourself with two important options:

- `--dry-run`: Runs the command without creating resources. Use `--dry-run=client` to test if a resource can be created without actually creating it.
- `-o yaml`: Outputs the resource definition in YAML format to the screen.

These options can be combined with Linux output redirection to quickly generate a resource definition file, which can then be modified and used to create resources.

### Example Command

```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-pod.yaml

```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx



### Generate POD Manifest YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it(--dry-run) 
```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml


Generate POD Manifest YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it(--dry-run)

kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml



Deployment
Create a deployment

kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx



Generate Deployment YAML file (-o yaml). Don't create it(--dry-run)

kubectl create deployment --image=nginx nginx --dry-run -o yaml



Generate Deployment with 4 Replicas

kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx --replicas=4



You can also scale deployment using the kubectl scale command.

kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=4



Another way to do this is to save the YAML definition to a file and modify

kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx--dry-run=client -o yaml > nginx-deployment.yaml



You can then update the YAML file with the replicas or any other field before creating the deployment.



Service
Create a Service named redis-service of type ClusterIP to expose pod redis on port 6379

kubectl expose pod redis --port=6379 --name redis-service --dry-run=client -o yaml

(This will automatically use the pod's labels as selectors)

Or

kubectl create service clusterip redis --tcp=6379:6379 --dry-run=client -o yaml (This will not use the pods' labels as selectors; instead it will assume selectors as app=redis. You cannot pass in selectors as an option. So it does not work well if your pod has a different label set. So generate the file and modify the selectors before creating the service)



Create a Service named nginx of type NodePort to expose pod nginx's port 80 on port 30080 on the nodes:

kubectl expose pod nginx --port=80 --name nginx-service --type=NodePort --dry-run=client -o yaml

(This will automatically use the pod's labels as selectors, but you cannot specify the node port. You have to generate a definition file and then add the node port in manually before creating the service with the pod.)

Or

kubectl create service nodeport nginx --tcp=80:80 --node-port=30080 --dry-run=client -o yaml

(This will not use the pods' labels as selectors)

Both the above commands have their own challenges. While one of it cannot accept a selector the other cannot accept a node port. I would recommend going with the `kubectl expose` command. If you need to specify a node port, generate a definition file using the same command and manually input the nodeport before creating the service.

# A quick note on editing Pods and Deployments

Edit a POD
Remember, you CANNOT edit specifications of an existing POD other than the below.

spec.containers[*].image

spec.initContainers[*].image

spec.activeDeadlineSeconds

spec.tolerations

For example you cannot edit the environment variables, service accounts, resource limits (all of which we will discuss later) of a running pod. But if you really want to, you have 2 options:

1. Run the kubectl edit pod <pod name> command.  This will open the pod specification in an editor (vi editor). Then edit the required properties. When you try to save it, you will be denied. This is because you are attempting to edit a field on the pod that is not editable.



A copy of the file with your changes is saved in a temporary location as shown above.

You can then delete the existing pod by running the command:

kubectl delete pod webapp



Then create a new pod with your changes using the temporary file

kubectl create -f /tmp/kubectl-edit-ccvrq.yaml



2. The second option is to extract the pod definition in YAML format to a file using the command

kubectl get pod webapp -o yaml > my-new-pod.yaml

Then make the changes to the exported file using an editor (vi editor). Save the changes

vi my-new-pod.yaml

Then delete the existing pod

kubectl delete pod webapp

Then create a new pod with the edited file

kubectl create -f my-new-pod.yaml



Edit Deployments
With Deployments you can easily edit any field/property of the POD template. Since the pod template is a child of the deployment specification,  with every change the deployment will automatically delete and create a new pod with the new changes. So if you are asked to edit a property of a POD part of a deployment you may do that simply by running the command

kubectl edit deployment my-deployment
